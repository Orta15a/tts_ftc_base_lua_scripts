FTC Map Base Lua Scripts v2.33

The following files contain all the LUA scripts contained in the FTC Base Map for the TTS 40k community. If a file does not exist for an object within the TTS save, then that
object does not contain any scripts.

This repo now contains the actual TTS JSON file. To produce the JSON file, run the compile.ps1 script.

All credit goes to GenWilhelm, Phubar, and Mothman_Zack for all the hard work! Also, thank you to Zyllos and Kurcenkurce for the updates and bug fixes!

Thanks to BaconCatBug for the BCB Customized Dice Roller v3 that this mod uses!
