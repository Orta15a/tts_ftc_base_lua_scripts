# tts_ftc_base_lua_scripts
FTC Map Base Lua Scripts v2.32

The following files contain all the LUA scripts contained in the FTC Base Map for the TTS 40k community. If a file does not exist for an object within the TTS save, then that
object does not contain any scripts.

All credit goes to GenWilhelm, Phubar, and Mothman_Zack for all the hard work!

Thanks to BaconCatBug for the BCB Customised Dice Roller v3 that this mod uses!
